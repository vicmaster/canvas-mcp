/**
 * Phase 29 slice B (#194) — design-system preservation.
 *
 * A canvas under a workspace design system resolves some tokens through
 * inheritance. `applyPresetTokens` deliberately does NOT clobber those: the
 * design system set them on purpose. But preservation used to be all-or-
 * nothing per token, and that produced a silent failure the checkout attempt
 * walked straight into — an inherited `body` carrying only a size shadowed the
 * generated role's whole spec, so `$body` kept the inherited 13px AND lost the
 * personality's font family. Nothing errored; the text just rendered in the
 * fallback stack.
 *
 * Run with: npx tsx test-preservation.ts
